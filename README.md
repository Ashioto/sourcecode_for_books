multiply books' source code

I found that parcticing is a quite good method to master a skill. Only reading the books but not doing it isn't a 
good idea for me. So, this repo is a collection of books which I read recently.
Now ,the title of books are shown below.

> * algrithm  
> * gray hat python  
> * method of programming  


also, some ctf writeup(s) are included.


some codes in the book, or the answers about exercises in the book.

just for practice.
